# Mocha - Read The Docs

This is a RTD, build with mkdocs, and is deployed by default on Github


## Contribution in Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown and is located under `/docs` 
 
[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is used to create HTML from the `/docs` files. 

To install:

    pip install mkdocs 

At the root of the directory, MkDocs uses the conf file `mkdocs.yml`. To add
 new menu, add it under `pages`

### Edit Docs & make pull requests

Edit the files that needs updates or needs to be created under `/docs`. Files
are in Markdown format. 

If you are adding a new doc file, you may want to put it in `mkdocs.yml` under
`pages` so it can be shown in the menu.

Run this command to see the changes and look etc

    mkdocs serve
    
**Then commit and push your code in `master` to make a pull request.**

Do not COMMIT or PUSH the `/site` directory generated by MkDocs.
 
But if you wish to publish the doc site under your own github domain, 
run the command below:

    mkdocs gh-deploy --clean

But it's still best to make a pull request and share the docs.

That's it.
